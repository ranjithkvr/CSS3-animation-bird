For 27 years, CIO Magazine has been recognizing companies that are using IT in innovative ways to deliver business value by creating competitive advantages, optimizing business processes, enabling growth or improving relationships with customers.

This year, Verizon has been awarded the 2014 CIO 100 Award for its technological leadership with Mobile Coach, a new tool to help call center supervisors better engage with their teams, improving customer service and ultimately growing revenue.

Mobile Coach was a collaborative effort between IT and National Operations. The app gives supervisors a real-time view into their employees’ ability to handle calls with customers, including up-to-the-minute assessments of both the individual employee as well as the team as a whole.

Previously, supervisors were tied to their desks as this information came from multiple data sources. Now, these new capabilities are loaded onto a tablet making supervisors and managers “mobile” by giving them the information to carry onto the call center floor.


“I’m very proud of my team for their laser focus on the customer and determination in delivering state-of-the-art innovative technology which enables better customer service and ultimately, improves customer growth and loyalty.”

- Mahmoud El-Assir, CIO, CMB IT

Mobile Coach also introduces new real-time speech capabilities that notify management of critical customer interactions while expanding speech analytics which supervisors already used to identify customer retention opportunities. As a result, supervisors can intervene while the customer is still on the call to help representatives provide the best service solutions for the customer


“We’re on a journey to differentiate our customer service. With the support of IT, we’re getting there. Mobile Coach enables our supervisors to help their team deliver the best solution on every interaction.

- Ken Lain, National Operations
